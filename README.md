Factorial field manipulation reveals multi-stressor effects on a critical habitat-forming shellfish


This file contains the information about the datasets used in Rangel et al. 2025 where we conducted a 6-month long field manipulation of pH and temperature in 20 tide pools in Sitka, Alaska and measured effects on the mussel Mytilus trossulus shell function and structure. We measured mussel shell thickness, strength, and corrosion.
